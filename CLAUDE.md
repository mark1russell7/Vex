# Instructions for Claude

## Writing style

Write all prose of this repository in the style of ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (STE). This prose is the README files, this file, the TSDoc comments, the docs and the text that the site shows. The linter [`ste-lint`](https://github.com/mark1russell7/ste-lint) examines it.

- After a change to prose, start `pnpm lint:ste` and correct each finding. CI fails when there is an error.
- Keep each instruction to 20 words or fewer, and each description to 25 words or fewer.
- Do not use the modal verbs (`should`, `may`, `might`, `would`), semicolons or Latin abbreviations (`e.g.`, `i.e.`, `etc.`).
- Use the active voice. Start each sentence of a doc comment with its subject: "This function returns the value", not "Returns the value".
- Put code, file names and commands in code font. The linter counts each code span as one word.
- Add a word to the glossary in `ste.config.json` only if it is a real technical term of the project.

## The plan

`docs/REVIEW.md` is the plan of record. Read it before a change to the architecture. Its §6 is the target design, and its §11 is the roadmap.

## Packages

- Make a new package with `pnpm package add <name> --preset=ts`. Do not write `package.json` or `tsconfig.json` by hand.
- Each package has a `tsconfig.test.json`. `pnpm typecheck` checks the source and the tests.
- `@vex/core` has no runtime dependencies. Other packages depend on it, and it depends on none of them.

## Tests

- Each normative statement of the spec has a requirement ID. Each requirement ID has a test that names it.
- Each defect from `docs/archive/2026-07/BUGS.md` (V-001 to V-042) has a row in `spec/regressions.md`, and each row with the status `test` has a test that names its ID.
- Start `pnpm check` before a commit. It does the type check, Oxlint, the coverage, the tests, the doc tests and `ste-lint`.
- A code block of the docs with the meta word `doctest` is a test. Write `// => value` for a value and `// : Type` for a type.
- A golden file in `packages/core/src/__golden__` changes only with a change of the semantics. To accept it, start `vitest run -u`.
