# The Vex language, version 1.0

This document is the specification of Vex 1.0. Each normative statement has a requirement ID in square brackets, for example `[EVAL.TOTAL]`. Each requirement ID has at least one test that names it. The test `spec-coverage.test.ts` makes CI fail when an ID has no test, or when a test names an ID that this document does not define.

The design and the reasons for it are in [`docs/REVIEW.md`](../docs/REVIEW.md). The v0.9 specification is in [`docs/archive/spec-v0.9.md`](../docs/archive/spec-v0.9.md).

## 1. Model

A Vex program is an expression. It evaluates at one key of a space. The key where it starts is the origin. The key where relative references read is the focus. At the start, the focus is the origin.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| space | An immutable collection of records with keys: a record space, an array space or a grid space |
| origin | The key where an evaluation starts |
| focus | The key where a reference without an address reads |
| address | A list of moves from the focus |
| axis | A relation between the focus and a list of target keys |
| domain | A set of values and the ops on them |
| result | A value, or an error value with a code |

## 2. Spaces

- A record space has the property names of an object as keys, in their order.
- An array space has the keys `"0"`, `"1"` and so on.
- A grid space has the key `"row,column"` for each cell. A row can be shorter than the others.
- A space copies its input. A later change to the input does not change the space.

## 3. Addresses

A move changes the key where a reference reads.

- **[NAV.KEY]** The move `key(k)` goes to the key `k`. If the space has no key `k`, the result is the error `#REF!`.
- **[NAV.INDEX]** The move `index(i)` goes to the key at position `i` in the key order. A position outside the keys gives `#REF!`.
- **[NAV.OTHER.PAIR]** The move `other` goes to the other key of a space with two keys. In a space with a different number of keys, it gives `#REF!`.
- **[NAV.OFFSET]** The move `offset(d)` adds `d` to the position of the focus: one number in an array space, two numbers in a grid space. A position outside the space, or an offset in a record space, gives `#REF!`.
- **[NAV.ORIGIN]** The move `origin` goes back to the origin of the evaluation.
- **[NAV.SEQUENCE]** The moves of an address apply in order. If one move fails, the address fails. Vex does not simplify addresses, because a simplification could hide a failure.

## 4. Expressions

An expression is plain JSON data. It has one of these kinds.

| Kind | Fields | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `lit` | `value` | the value |
| `ref` | `path`, `at` | the field at the path, in the record at the address |
| `app` | `op`, `args` | the op applied to the values of the arguments |
| `let` | `bind`, `body` | the body, with names bound to the values of the bindings |
| `var` | `name` | the value of a bound name |
| `rec` | `fields` | a record of the values of the fields |
| `each` | `axis`, `body` | a list: the body at each target of the axis |
| `ext` | `kind`, `data` | the value of an extension handler |

- **[IR.JSON]** An expression whose literals are JSON data gives the same expression after `serialize` and `parse`. A literal that is a domain value needs `encode` and `decode` in its domain.

## 5. Evaluation

- **[EVAL.TOTAL]** The interpreter does not throw. It gives a value or an error value. A value is not `undefined`.
- **[EVAL.PURE]** An evaluation does not change any state. Two evaluations of the same expression at the same key give the same result.
- **[EVAL.ORIGIN]** An origin that is not a key of the space gives `#REF!`.
- **[EVAL.REFERENCE]** The interpreter of `@vex/core` and the reference interpreter of `@vex/testkit` give the same value or the same error code.

### 5.1 References

- **[REF.FOCUS]** A reference without an address reads the field at the focus.
- **[REF.PATH]** A path with more than one segment reads nested fields. The empty path reads the whole record.
- **[REF.MISSING]** A missing field, or a field with the value `null`, gives `#N/A`.
- **[REF.FORBIDDEN]** The segments `__proto__`, `constructor` and `prototype` are not fields. They give `#N/A`.
- **[REF.ADDRESS]** A reference with an address reads at the key where the address points. A failed address gives `#REF!`.

### 5.2 Ops

- **[CALL.METHOD]** For an op without `fn`, the interpreter calls the method of the receiver with the same name.
- **[CALL.FN]** For an op with `fn`, the interpreter calls `fn` with the receiver and the other arguments.
- **[CALL.UNKNOWN-OP]** An op that the domain of the receiver does not declare gives `#NAME?`. An inherited member, for example `toString`, is not an op.
- **[CALL.RECEIVER]** A receiver that no domain accepts gives `#VALUE!`, if no free function has the name of the op.
- **[CALL.FREE]** A free function applies when no domain accepts the receiver.
- **[CALL.PARAMS]** If an op declares the kinds of its parameters, an argument of the wrong kind gives `#VALUE!`.
- **[CALL.LIFT]** If an op declares `liftScalar`, the interpreter changes each number argument into a domain value with `fromScalar`.
- **[CALL.THROW]** An op that throws gives `#CALC!`. The error keeps the thrown value.
- **[CALL.RESULT]** An op result that is `undefined` or `null` gives `#CALC!`. A number that is not finite, or a domain value that fails the `valid` check of its domain, gives `#NUM!`.
- **[CALL.ARGS]** The interpreter evaluates all arguments. One failed argument gives its own error. Two or more failed arguments give `#ARGS`, with each error as a cause.
- **[CALL.STRING-ARGS]** A string literal is a value. The builder makes a field reference only from a bare string.

### 5.3 Bindings and records

- **[LET.BIND]** `let` binds each name to the value of its binding, for the body.
- **[LET.LAZY-ERROR]** A binding that fails has an effect only where a `var` reads it.
- **[LET.UNBOUND]** A name without a binding gives `#NAME?`.
- **[LET.VARS]** The caller of the interpreter can give variables.
- **[REC.FIELDS]** `rec` makes a record of its fields. Two or more failed fields give `#ARGS`.

### 5.4 Axes

- **[AXIS.ALL]** The axis `all` has each key of the space as a target.
- **[AXIS.OTHERS]** The axis `others` has each key except the focus as a target.
- **[AXIS.OTHERS.ORIGIN]** Inside an axis, the focus is the target, and the origin does not change. A value bound outside the axis keeps its value. Thus a base value from the origin and a field of the target can meet in one body.
- **[AXIS.OTHER.PAIR]** The axis `other` has the other key of a pair as a target. Outside a pair, it gives `#REF!`.
- **[AXIS.NEIGHBORS]** The axis `neighbors(4)` or `neighbors(8)` has the neighbor cells of the focus in a grid as targets. Outside a grid, it gives `#REF!`.
- **[AXIS.WHERE]** The axis `where(axis, test)` keeps the targets of `axis` where `test` gives `true`. A test that fails, or that does not give a boolean, gives an error item for that target.
- **[AXIS.OTHERS-UNION]** The targets of `others` and the focus are the targets of `all`.
- **[AXIS.OTHER-TWICE]** In a pair, the address `[other, other]` points to the focus.
- **[AXIS.EXTEND]** For an expression that does not read the origin, the item at key `k` of `each(all, e)` equals `e` evaluated at origin `k`. This is the law of a comonad: extract after extend gives the program.

### 5.5 Lists

- **[LIST.LENIENT]** A list op skips error items by default. With `{ strict: true }`, the first error item is the result.
- **[LIST.EMPTY]** `min`, `max`, `mean` and `first` of an empty list give `#N/A`. `sum` gives 0 and `count` gives 0. `reduce` gives the identity of the op, or `#N/A` if the op has no identity.
- **[LIST.KINDS]** `sum`, `mean`, `min` and `max` need numbers. `any`, `all` and `none` need booleans. A value of another kind gives `#VALUE!`.
- **[LIST.REDUCE]** `reduce` folds the values from the left with a domain op. For an associative op, any order of reduction gives the same value.

### 5.6 Special forms

- **[FORM.IF]** `if` evaluates only the branch that its condition selects. A condition that is not a boolean gives `#VALUE!`.
- **[FORM.AND-OR]** `and` and `or` stop at the first argument that decides the result.
- **[FORM.IFERROR]** `ifError` gives its first argument, or its second argument when the first is an error.

## 6. Folds

- **[TRACE.EVENTS]** `explain` records one event for each node evaluation, in the order that the nodes finish. A reference event records its reads.
- **[TRACE.AXIS]** Inside an axis, the focus of each event is the target.
- **[DEPS.READS]** `deps` gives each reference of an expression, with its address and the axes around it.

## 7. Domains

- **[DOMAIN.OWNED]** A domain owns its op table. `defineDomain` does not change a class or a prototype, and an import has no side effects.
- **[DOMAIN.LAWS]** Each law that a domain declares holds for the values of the domain. `@vex/testkit` checks each law with property tests.

## 8. The builder

- **[BUILD.IMMUTABLE]** A builder call gives a new chain. An earlier chain does not change.
- **[TYPE.FROM]** `from(p)` accepts only the fields of the record type, and the chain value has the type of the field.
- **[TYPE.OPS]** `._` has only the ops of the domain of the current value, with the parameter types of each op.
- **[TYPE.LIFT]** A number argument for a domain parameter needs `liftScalar` on the op.
- **[TYPE.STATE]** After an op gives a value that no domain of the chain accepts, the chain has no `._`.
- **[TYPE.OTHER]** `other()` exists only on a chain over a space with two keys, or with keys that the compiler does not know.
- **[TYPE.KEYS]** Evaluation accepts only the keys of the space.
- **[TYPE.LIST]** A number reduction needs a list of numbers.
- **[TYPE.NO-ANY]** No value type of the builder is `any`.

## 9. Examples

- **[EXAMPLE.SEPARATION]** The test is `position + size - other.position` in a pair of boxes. A component that is not positive shows that the box at the origin ends before the other box starts.
- **[EXAMPLE.NEAREST]** The minimum of the distances from the origin to the others is the distance to the nearest other record.
- **[EXAMPLE.OFFSETS]** The reduction with `add` of the offsets from the origin to the others is the sum of the offsets.
